Crapper:

* Users input their salary and hours per day/week
* Calculate money earned while doing a poo
    * Can get money earned for any given time
    * Can also begin a timer at the start of your toilet breaks to find out how much each break was worth
* Facebook integration, users must be able to post/share how much they earn pooing on Facebook
* User accounts, local and linked to Facebook
* Backend is a RESTful Node service
* Can anonymously pool user data from a company (would require people to disclose company) to work out how much that company has paid people to go toilet
* Must use Redux
* Choose teams/companies - called groups - you belong to, time logged will show how much they have paid you to poo
* Set times when you are on the clock for each group you belong to, can manually extend, eg. doing overtime
* Break down time paid to use the loo per project, factor in any bonuses at the end
